#### Implementation of some simple classical and quantum systems

The simulation are implementations of the Programming drills from the book Quantum Computing for Computer Scientists, 
by Noson S. Yanofsky and  Mirco A. Mannucci. The programs are written in Julia programming language. The simulations demostrate the state vectors and the time evolution (dynamics) of some simple classical and quantum systems. All the systems are modelled as graphs which in turn are modelled as matrices. The time evolution corresponds to matrix multiplication of the dynamics matrix and the state vector. Many things have been assumed for simplyfing the simulations.
